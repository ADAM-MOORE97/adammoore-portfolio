      <div id="intro">
      <p>I'm Adam, a full-stack engineer who loves problem solving. After dabbling in code for several years, I decided to enroll in Flatiron School's Software Engineering program in order to enhance my skills and prepare for the next step in my career.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Previously, I worked as a firefighter and EMT where I earned multiple certifications; never letting a chance to enhance my skill set and broaden my knowledge pass me by. It was in this role that I developed the communication and time management skills that are essential when working within a team at a high-stress level. Along with my professional career, I owned and operated a small landscaping business with forty-five individual clients and two employees. This experience allowed me to sharpen my leadership and organizational skills. By taking advantage of these experiences, I was able to devote more time to my passion for technology, leading to my dream of transitioning to full-time web development.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>As a recent graduate of this software engineering course, I am eager to learn more about other frameworks and languages as well as sharpen the skills that I gained as a result of the course. If you are looking for a passionate, focused, and efficient full-stack engineer that is eager to take on any challenge, then please reach out to me.</p>
